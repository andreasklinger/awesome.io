We are locked to the ground of technological advancement.</p>\n\n<p>Although the Internet is a generation defining technological advancement, it feels like it&#8217;s <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2013/01/03/why-silicon-valley-innovation-has-stalled/">stalled</a>, to some even <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/30/im-bored-whats-next/">boring</a>. Trapped in constant mental incest some say it became a bit repetitive, driven by an ecosystem flawed by it&#8217;s own survivor bias.</p>\n\n<p>But the Internet aside I feel that the problem is even bigger, if you zoom out from the last years to the last decades. <strong>There is something fundamentally wrong with our society&#8217;s attitude towards science and innovation</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Reasons for Disenchantment: The illusion of progress</h2>\n\n<p>Our present day doesn&#8217;t feel futuristic and our future does not feel on its verge to come.</p>\n\n<p>Looking past at the cultural artifacts left by earlier generations it feels like that <strong>the 50s, 60s and even the 70s had a different approach to their future</strong>. They believed in technologic advancements and even more <strong>they believed that they could actively invent it themselves</strong>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;We have discarded a century of can-do ambition built on rapid advances in technology and replaced it with a cautiousness far too satisfied with incremental improvements.&#8221; ~Garry Kasparov in <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/8adeca00-2996-11e2-a5ca-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2GoClvy9Z">ft.com</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p><em>Highly recommend to watch: <a href="http://www.arte.tv/">ARTE</a> &#8220;Into the night&#8221; w/ Garry Kasparow &amp; Peter Thiel</em></p>\n\n<p>According to Garry Kasparow we slowed down. <strong>We lost ourselves in incremental improvements</strong> and wars of efficiencies, instead looking for disruptive developments and ambitious new projects.</p>\n\n<p>I personally do not agree with that view to the extreme Thiel and Kasparow put it. But i do believe that <strong>judging technologic advancement by the resulted IPO-size and not by social-impact leads to short-term thinking</strong> and repetitive patterns based on survivor bias.</p>\n\n<p>But the problem might be bigger than that…</p>\n\n<h3>Reasons for Disenchantment: The role of science</h3>\n\n<p>I believe our excitement for science is at an all-time low.</p>\n\n<p>Watch popular media of the last decades and you will see the public sentiment/portrait towards people pushing technological development. If development is celebrated it is in form of &#8220;quirky science stuff&#8221; or &#8220;high techie-techie&#8221;. It is ok for talk-show-moderators to shout into the camera that they have no idea about math or science.</p>\n\n<p>The public media presents characters – may they be fictionally or images of real people – which are either dorky scientists waiting for the ex-quarterback to solve everything with a witty common-knowledge-solution or the inventors are approximated to rock-stars or artists, the next best thing of a visionary persona our society wants to understand.</p>\n\n<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/51adc1810bd165d643b52fdfce9e5a06/tumblr_inline_mg1y91hp3a1r5v9i8.jpg" alt=""/></p>\n\n<p>Our society has no big craving to invent radical innovation. <strong>We need to unravel a new interest in science and innovation</strong> – a new love for visionary/crazy projects tackling 20-year projects.</p>\n\n<p>To make the future happen we need <strong>inspire ourselves as well as the next generations of creators</strong>. We need to <strong>communicate with the public</strong> and <strong>change this fundamentally wrong sentiment</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Science needs to become cool.</p>\n\n<p>Until then,</p>\n\n<p>The sky is only the limit if you are too afraid to build rocket ships</p>\n\n<p><ul><li>Never rush into answering</li>\n<li>Listen patiently</li>\n<li>Write your thoughts down</li>\n<li>Give them one focused answer</li>\n<li>Walk them through and catch them where they are </li>\n<li>Show empathy and understand their point of view.</li>\n</ul><blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Empathy</strong> requires something extremely difficult: accepting the fact that we are not and never will be in the other person&#8217;s shoes. There&#8217;s no rational, universal course because individuals have different goals, different worldviews and different experiences. – <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2012/11/i-know-what-you-should-do.html">Seth Godin</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>4. Do ask, don&#8217;t tell.</h4>\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t push your knowledge on the founders, instead <strong>focus on asking the &#8220;right&#8221; (slow) questions</strong> and help them to get their thoughts forward.</p>\n~ <a href="http://www.twitter.com/andreasklinger">@andreasklinger</a></p>\n'
